# Social Media Campaign Performance Tracker

## Project Overview

This project features a comprehensive dashboard for tracking and analyzing the performance of social media campaigns. Built to provide a clear and intuitive view of key metrics, this dashboard helps marketing teams and stakeholders monitor campaign effectiveness, identify trends, and make data-driven adjustments.

## Features

The dashboard is designed with a focus on quick insights and trend analysis, featuring:

-   **High-Level KPIs:** Prominently displayed metrics provide an immediate snapshot of the campaign's overall health:
    -   **Total Ads:** The total number of advertisements run.
    -   **Total Responses:** The total number of user responses to the campaigns.
    -   **Total Complaints:** A crucial metric for monitoring brand sentiment and campaign quality.
    -   **Total Income:** The total revenue generated from the campaigns.

-   **Geographical and Demographic Insights:** A detailed table breaks down performance by country and educational level, offering a granular view of which demographics and regions are most engaged and profitable.

-   **Time-Series Analysis:** The dashboard includes several line charts to visualize performance over time, helping to identify trends and seasonal patterns:
    -   **Total Income by Month:** Tracks monthly revenue generation.
    -   **Total Complaints by Month:** Monitors changes in customer complaints over time.
    -   **Total Ads by Month:** Shows the monthly volume of ads being run.
    -   **Total Responses by Month:** Illustrates monthly changes in user engagement.

## Key Insights & Recommendations

Based on the data visualized in the dashboard, the following insights and recommendations can be derived:

### Insights

-   **Complaint Spikes:** There is a notable spike in complaints during the early part of the year (January-February) and a secondary increase around the middle of the year (July-August). This suggests potential issues with campaign content or timing during these periods.
-   **Income and Ad Correlation:** Total Income and Total Ads show a somewhat parallel trend, with both peaking around March-April and again in October-November. This suggests that increasing ad volume directly correlates with an increase in income.
-   **Strong Performance in Specific Regions:** The table indicates strong income generation in countries like AUS and CA, while some others, like US and GER, show lower income figures in certain campaign cycles.
-   **Campaign Cycle Effectiveness:** The "2n Cycle" campaigns appear to be a significant driver of income, as highlighted in the detailed table.

### Recommendations

-   **Investigate Complaint Spikes:** Conduct a deep dive into the campaigns that ran during the periods of high complaints to understand the root cause. This could be related to ad content, targeting, or external factors.
-   **Optimize Ad Spending:** Focus on increasing ad spend during the high-performing periods (March-April and October-November) and potentially re-evaluating ad spend during low-performing months to maximize ROI.
-   **Geographic and Demographic Targeting:** Tailor campaigns to specific regions and educational levels that show high profitability (e.g., AUS, CA with "2n Cycle" education level) and A/B test new strategies in underperforming areas.
-   **Replicate Successful Campaigns:** Analyze the characteristics of the successful "2n Cycle" campaigns and apply those learnings to other campaigns to improve overall performance.

## Technologies Used

-   **Power BI:** Used for data visualization, dashboard creation, and interactive reporting.

## How to Use

The dashboard is interactive. Users can use the `Year` and `Country` slicers at the top right to filter the data and gain specific insights into different time periods or geographical markets.
